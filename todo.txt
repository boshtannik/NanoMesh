Things are left to do:

* ??? May be add self-adjustable listening period.
  It may be useful to automatically adjust listening period
  between messages in the mesh pool. It might be working in the following
  way. The more messages were caught in some period of time - the more delays
  nodes will use between messaging, which should reduce possible
  jamming of ether.

* Add public methods for transciever:
  1 - send_guaranteed_at_least_once - Send packet, wait for acknowledge, and return result (Sent / Sending failed)
  2 - send_guaranteed_only_once - Send packet, and guarantee, that receiver has used it only 1 time, and return result (Sent / Sending failed)

* !!! Seeoms only reasonable modules to establish radio connection are
  wireless USART extender modules, such as jdy-40, jdy-41, sv-610, hc-11, hc-12, lc12s,
  GT-38. or bad chinese ones as WSN-31 other radio-uart module, that allow to
  transmit byte to multiple receiving devices at once.

  Choose radio modules with frequency that is legal in your country.
  In case, if no free communication is legal in
  your country - Leave your country for better perfomance!

  The way to send / receive data - is via rx / tx pins of MCU,
  which this library code is designed for.
