Things are left to do:

* (DONE) Modify the packet in order to:
    * Void dead packets in the ether by producing lifetime of packet to be
      transitted over the network. The lack of destination
      device in the pool - will cause the radio ether being jammed
      by lost packets that can not reach their destination point, and
      will be copied and re-transitted by every transcievers.

* Add Red LED marker which shall be lighted on critical
  situation is reached. Like unwrap went wrong.
  All panic situations shall be handled, in order to void any
  panic and mark LED diode to tell that, some problem occurred. - Opposite is DONE. Stops blinking if panicked.

* ??? May be add self-adjustable listening period.
  It may be useful to automatically adjust listening period
  between messages in the mesh pool. It might be working in the following
  way. The more messages were caught in some period of time - the more delays
  nodes will use between messaging, which should reduce possible
  jamming of ether.

* !!! Seeoms only reasonable modules to establish radio connection are
  wireless USART extender modules, such as djy-40, djy-41, sv-610, hc-11, hc-12, lc12s,
  GT-38. or bad chinese ones as WSN-31 other radio-uart module, that allow to
  transmit byte to multiple receiving devices at once.
  The cheapest and expected way to send / receive data - is via
  rx / tx pins of MCU, which this code is working on.
